1. What are some factors that would help a development organization move
from Beizer’s testing level 2 (testing is to show errors) to testing level 4
(a mental discipline that increases quality)?

In Level 2 tetsing, the purpose is to show failures. But Level 3 tesing show 
the presence, not absence or failure.
If we use software, we expose some risks. The risk may be smal and unimportant
, or the risk may be great and the consequences are catastrophic, but the risk
is always there.
In level 3 testing, both testers and developers work together to reduce risk.
Once the testers and developers are on the same "team", an organization can progress to
real Level 4 testing.


2. What is the difference between software fault and software failure?

Software failure occurs when the software does not do what the user expects to see.
Software fault, on the other hand, is a hidden programming error.
A software fault becomes a software failure only when the exact computation conditions are met, and the faulty portion of the code is executed on the CPU.

3. What do we mean by “level 3 thinking is that the purpose of testing is to reduce
risk?” What risk? Can we reduce the risk to zero?

Testing can show the presence of failures but not their absence.
Using the software, we are always at risk. The risk could be insignificant or could be significant.
We can't reduce the risk to zero.

6.Answer question (a) or (b), but not both, depending on your background.
(b) If you have never worked for a software development company, what level of test maturity do you think that you have? (0: testing=debugging, 1: testing shows correctness,
2: testing shows the program doesn’t work, 3: testing reduces risk, 4: testing is a mental
discipline about quality).

I think i have level 0(testing = debugging) of test maturity since i do not have any experience 
in software testing.
